**Requirements**
Processing 3.0 with Oscp5 addon (libraries - search)
Python 3.5 with python-osc library (pip3 install python-osc)

**What does it do?**
The animation built in processing (with the help of Memo Atken's tutorial: http://www.memo.tv/works/) - moviing the mouse aound the screen animates some 
3D boxes with a tail effect. Messages from weatherAPI.py (openweathermap.org) are sent via OSC to the processing program to control the behaviour of the tail's 'wind' effect.
